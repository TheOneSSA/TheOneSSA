<h3>About Me....</h3>
I am a student of Computer Science and Engineering. Being curious about learning new things and exploring new technologies boosts my learning ability. I really like to connect with people ,know their culture and learn from their experience. Fortunately, in my last collaboration with Omdena, I was able to connect with talented individuals from different parts of the world and learn from them.
I also love Mathematics. Numbers are really fascinating, from having a better grasp at conventional coding to learning the concepts of Machine Learning, the numbers have always provided me a solution.

<br>
I love to explore any tech that I can get my hands on and for me the best way to learn anything is implementation. Currently, along with Data Science, I have also been entangled with Quantum Computing. The advent of qubits has countless possibilities, starting from scalability to finding solutions for the 'undecidable' problems of today's world. But personally, I can't wait for the normalization of Teleportation [The sooner, the better]
<br><br>
When I ain't tinkering, I usually spend my time COOKING, Watching Anime or learning and practicing self-defense techniques.
